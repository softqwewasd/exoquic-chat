# A simple chat app with Github Organizations built on Exoquic MVP.
https://exoquic.com
## What is this demonstrating?
The ease of building and maintaining a chat app with Exoquic and how different chat-like features can be implemented, such as typing indicator, message read status, etc.

### Features:
- Real time direct chat with Github users
- Real time group chat with Github teams
- Chat history

All of these features are implemented without the use of a database, just Exoquic.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Setup a Github OAuth application and add the client id and secret to the .env file
* Generate an ExoQuic API key and add it to the .env file

### Starting the app (Nextjs default docs)

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
